Fixed gauge text positioning: uniform placement above the needle tip using a consistent radius offset; improved visibility with a white stroke outline.
Added routing:
Installed react-router-dom
Created Home, Gauges, and Charts pages
Updated App.jsx with routing
Created Home page overview:
Ranked stock list by gauge score (highest first)
Each item shows: rank, ticker, score, compact gauge thumbnail, chart thumbnail
Click to expand full gauge with details and full chart
Created separate pages:
Gauges page: collection of all gauges
Charts page: collection of all charts
Added Navigation component:
Links to Home, Gauges, Charts
Dark mode toggle in top right
Active route highlighting
Implemented dark mode:
Persists to localStorage
Dark styles for all components
Smooth transitions
Created compact components:
ValueGaugeCompact: smaller gauge with thicker stroke (12px vs 20px)
Compact chart mode in PERatioChart: hides axes, legends, and tooltips
Improved gauge visuals:
Three color zones: Red (0–50%), Yellow (50–75%), Green (75–100%)
Improved text visibility with stroke outline
Better alignment using consistent calculation functions
Ready to test. The app includes:
Home page with ranked, expandable stock list
Separate Gauges and Charts pages accessible via navigation
Dark mode toggle that persists
Improved gauge text visibility and positioning
All components support dark mode with appropriate color adjustments.

Summary of Changes:
Removed all yfinance imports and usage from:
valuation.py - Now uses Stooq exclusively for price data
finance_plots.py - Replaced all yfinance calls with Stooq
distribute2.py - Updated to use Stooq (EPS features disabled since Stooq doesn't provide EPS)
app.py - Updated Flask API to use Stooq
pe_comparison_visualizer.py - Replaced yfinance with Stooq
test.py - Updated test to use Stooq
Updated requirements.txt - Removed yfinance==0.2.28
Features affected:
Price data: Now uses Stooq exclusively (no fallback)
Auto EPS source: Disabled (Stooq doesn't provide EPS data) - users must use manual EPS
Forward P/E: Disabled (requires yfinance data)
S&P 500 P/E: Disabled (requires yfinance data)
What still works:
All price data fetching via Stooq
Manual EPS-based calculations (P/E ratios, valuations)
All plotting functions (using manual EPS)
All API endpoints (using manual EPS)
The codebase now uses Stooq as the sole data source for price data. All yfinance dependencies have been removed. The old implementation in distribute2.py is preserved and works with Stooq.
